### Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Objective 1: Describe the key concepts covered in this chapter
- Objective 2: Apply the techniques learned to solve problems
- Objective 3: Analyze and evaluate different approaches
- Objective 4: Create your own solutions using the tools provided

:::

## Introduction

Provide a compelling introduction to the chapter. Explain why this topic is important and how it fits into the broader context of the course.

::: {.callout-note}
## Context

Add any important contextual information that students should know before starting this chapter.

:::

## Main Section 1

Start with the fundamental concepts. Use clear, concise language.

### Subsection 1.1

Provide detailed explanations with examples.

```{python}
#| label: example-code
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false
#| warning: false

# Example code goes here
print("Hello, Course!")
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Pro Tip

Share helpful tips and best practices related to this concept.

:::

### Subsection 1.2

Continue building on the previous concepts.

::: {.card .card-primary}
::: {.card-body}

#### Key Concept Box

Use cards to highlight important concepts or definitions.

**Definition**: Provide a clear, concise definition.

**Example**: Illustrate the concept with a practical example.

:::
:::

## Main Section 2

Introduce more advanced topics or build upon the fundamentals.

### Visualizations

Include relevant diagrams, charts, or images to enhance understanding.

```{python}
#| label: fig-visualization
#| fig-cap: "Caption describing what this figure shows"
#| fig-alt: "Alternative text for accessibility"
#| echo: false

# Code to generate visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Example plot
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, y, linewidth=2)
plt.title("Example Visualization")
plt.xlabel("X-axis label")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis label")
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()
```

### Tables

Present data in a clear, organized manner.

| Feature | Description | Importance |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Feature 1 | Explanation of feature 1 | High |
| Feature 2 | Explanation of feature 2 | Medium |
| Feature 3 | Explanation of feature 3 | Low |

: Example table caption {#tbl-example}

As shown in @tbl-example, different features have varying levels of importance.

## Practical Applications
